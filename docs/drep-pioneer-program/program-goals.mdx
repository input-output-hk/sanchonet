## Goals of the Program

Intersect would like to sponsor a DRep Pioneer Program by inviting selected members to deliver the course to the Cardano community 
as Pioneer Workshop Leaders.

By the end of the program, a significant part of the community will be equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively 
participate in the new governance role - DRep.

A major goal of this initiative is to develop a continuous learning program that will support the first cohort of DReps’
to be able to effectively perform their role in Cardano’s proposed governance design.

A further goal of the program is to create materials that can be used ‘standalone’ independent from the training courses, so that a
potential DRep can train themselves on what is required in an intuitive and clear way.
