## Overview

The DRep training program is designed to enable participants to learn the skills and knowledge they need to effectively participate as Delegate Representatives (DReps) in the governance structure proposed for Cardano.

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for DRep Pioneers, who will play a pivotal role as instructors in training individuals from the Cardano Community interested in becoming DReps.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, participants will be able to:

* Understand the fundamentals of Cardano’s on-chain governance design.
* Understand the role and expectations of a DRep.
* Gain the skills to effectively become a DRep - both the practical and the ‘softer’ skills (e.g., marketing, building relationships).
* Engage with the Cardano community using the available tools for DReps.

## Goals of the DRep Pioneer Program

Intersect would like to sponsor a DRep Pioneer Program by inviting selected members to deliver the course to the Cardano community 
as Pioneer Workshop Leaders.

By the end of the program, a significant part of the community will be equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively 
participate in the new governance role - DRep.

A major goal of this initiative is to develop a continuous learning program that will support the first cohort of DReps’
to be able to effectively perform their role in Cardano’s proposed governance design.

A further goal of the program is to create materials that can be used ‘standalone’ independent from the training courses, so that a
potential DRep can train themselves on what is required in an intuitive and clear way.
