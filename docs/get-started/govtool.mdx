# SanchoNet GovTool

![SanchoNet GovTool Logo](../../static/img/sanchonet-govtool-header.png)

## What is the SanchoNet GovTool?

The SanchoNet GovTool allows ada holders to experience now some of the governance features described in [CIP-1694](https://www.1694.io/) and to test governance features in SanchoNet in a guided and simple experience.
The SanchoNet GovTool is currently open for beta testing and can be accessed at [sanchogov.tools](https://sanchogov.tools/).

## What is the Voltaire GovTool?

The Voltaire GovTool, of which the SanchoNet GovTool is the testnet version, will enable ada holders to register to become a Delegated Representative (DRep), delegate voting power to DReps, and review and vote on governance actions.
Governance tooling is owned and maintained by the community.
With community approval, Intersect, through its committees and working groups, will play an important role in hosting and maintaining these governance tools.
Through active community involvement, the aim is to create the initial foundation layer together with different builders in the community.
These governance tools will support the whole process, including both off-chain and on-chain, and as a whole they will support the implementation of the governance described in CIP-1694 and its adoption.
Once this foundation layer is ready, the community will be able to further contribute to these governance tools by maintaining and improving existing features and pillars, creating new features or completely new areas either by themselves or supported by awards and grants facilitated by Intersect.
With the freedom to test and refine Cardano’s next era of governance principles under one central apparatus, the GovTool helps the Cardano community forge a future governance framework that represents the community’s best democratic interests.

## How to participate in the beta testing?

The Voltaire GovTool will be one of the first tools that allows ADA holders to experience the CIP-1694 Governance on Cardano.
The current version of this tool has been developed using initial feedback from the community and following what's described in CIP-1694.
It's now important that the community tests this tool and provide valuable insights to further refine it and make it ready for future product use.
