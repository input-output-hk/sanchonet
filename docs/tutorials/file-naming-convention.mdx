To align the tutorials, examples, and also third-party tooling, you can find a suggested file naming convention/schema related to the Conway and Voltaire eras in this document.

The schemas can be extended with a `*.` prefix if needed. For example:

- Suggested file name: `drep.skey`
- Extended with a prefix: `myname.drep.skey`

The naming convention is a work in progress. Please revisit this page regularly to check if any new or modified schemas have been selected.
