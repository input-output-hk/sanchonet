To align the tutorials, examples and also 3rd-party tooling, you can find a suggested file naming convention/schema related to Conway/Voltaire Era in this document.

The schemas can be extended with a `*.` prefix if needed, here is an example:
- Suggested file name: `drep.skey`
- Extended with a prefix: `myname.drep.skey`

As this is all work in progress, please revisit this page regulary to see if any new or changed schemas were selected.
