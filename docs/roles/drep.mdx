# Delegate representatives (DReps)

## Becoming a DRep

As Cardano prepares to transition to the Conway era, active community participation becomes crucial for its success. One impactful way you can contribute is by becoming a Delegate Representative (DRep) and playing a pivotal role in shaping Cardano's future.

DReps hold significant responsibilities within the governance process, as they vote on essential updates to the system. The approval of these updates depends on the type of governance action and requires a majority vote from the corresponding governance bodies: Stake Pool Operators (SPOs), Constitutional Committee, and Delegate Representatives.

As a DRep, you will wield the power to cast your vote with a "yes," "no," or "abstain" on governance actions proposing changes to any updatable protocol parameters. Your vote represents the collective voice of Ada holders who have entrusted you with their voting rights, making your role instrumental in Cardano's decentralized decision-making process.

Join us in this momentous journey towards a decentralized future. Take the first step and register now to become a Delegate Representative on SanchoNet. Together, we will shape the destiny of Cardano's ecosystem.

To become a DRep, follow these steps:

1. Run a node.
2. Obtain funds from the faucet.
3. Register as a DRep with an on-chain registration certificate.
4. Initially, on SanchoNet, use tools like Discord to identify governance actions requiring your attention and vote.
5. Engage in discussions with other Dreps to assess the merits of active governance actions.
6. Cast your votes using Cardano-CLI or other voting tools as they become available in the community.
7. When submitting your votes, include reasoning for your vote, including an anchor (URL and hash).

Stay tuned for detailed tutorials that will be made available when new features are released. Additionally, the development team may request specific tests from SanchoNet participants, making your active participation even more crucial.
