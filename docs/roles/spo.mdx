# Stake pool operators (SPOs)

Stake pool operators are not only responsible for block production and network maintenance; they also 
have a role in the governance of the system. Stake pool operators can vote on motions of no confidence, 
electing new constitutional committee members, initiating hardforks, and making changes to security and 
relevant protocol parameters.
