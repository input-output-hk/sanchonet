# Stake Pool Operator (SPO)

Stake pool operators play a crucial role in the SanchoNet network as they are responsible for creating blocks and giving life to the network. In SanchoNet their significance goes beyond that. During the initial phases of SanchoNet, Stake Pool Operators take on an even more pivotal role as they are the only participants with the ability to vote on governance actions. This will be the case until the functionalities for DRep registration, delegation, and voting 
are released.

Becoming a Stake Pool Operator is the primary means to actively engage in the governance of SanchoNet during these early stages. 
The process is straightforward, and we have a helpful tutorial to guide you through it.
