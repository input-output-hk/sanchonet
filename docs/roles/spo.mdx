# Stake pool operators (SPOs)

During the initial phases of SanchoNet, SPOs have different responsibilities. Apart from block production and network maintenance, they play a pivotal role as the sole participants empowered to vote on governance actions. This arrangement will persist until the functionalities for delegate representative (DRep) registration, delegation, and voting are introduced.
