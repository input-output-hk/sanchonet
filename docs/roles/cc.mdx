## The Constitutional Committee: Guardians of the Cardano Blockchain's Integrity

The Constitutional Committee serves as a group of individuals or entities, each associated with a pair of Ed25519 credentials, with the collective responsibility of safeguarding the integrity of the Constitution within the Cardano blockchain ecosystem.

While the Constitution cannot be directly enforced on-chain, the primary role of the constitutional committee is to assess the constitutionality of governance actions. By doing so, they play a vital role in ensuring the blockchain's long-term sustainability. If the committee ever oversteps its designated boundary, it can be replaced through a "no confidence" action.

In essence, the constitutional committee operates based on a social contract with the network's actors. Their focus lies solely on voting in favor of actions that align with the Constitution, thereby upholding the fundamental principles and values of the blockchain.

It's important to note that the constitutional committee does possess the authority to reject certain governance actions by voting 'No.' However, they should exercise this power judiciously, solely when such actions are in clear conflict with the Constitution.

In summary, the Constitutional Committee acts as the guardians of the blockchain's integrity, ensuring that the network operates in harmony with its established principles. Through their responsible decision-making and adherence to the Constitution, they contribute to the sustainable and prosperous future of the blockchain ecosystem.

## Becoming a Constitutional Commmittee member

Becoming a member of the Constitutional Committee is an off-chain matter. The detailed process to become one will be provided in the following weeks. CC members will adopt a Cold/Hot keys setup, similar to how SPOs handle their Cold/KESKeys. Therefore, it is crucial to become familiar with generating such keys and handling them securely if you aspire to be a CC member.

As an overview, a CC member will need to:

1. Run a node.
2. Request funds from the faucet.
3. Generate Cold/Hot Keys.
4. Generate key hashes.
5. Create a corresponding Cold -> Hot Authorization certificate and submit it on-chain.
6. Review active governance actions.
7. Engage in discussions with other CC members to assess the constitutionality of governance actions.
8. Cast votes.
9. Include anchors (URL / hash) in their votes.

Moreover, CC members might be called upon to perform specific tests, such as issuing a new hot key and authorizing it, resigning as CC members, or voting on new CC members.

Detailed tutorials will be made available in a timely manner as we approach the release of related features. These tutorials will provide step-by-step instructions to guide you through the process seamlessly.
