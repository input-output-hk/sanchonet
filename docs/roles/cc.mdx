# Constitutional committee

The constitutional committee serves as a group of individuals or entities, each associated with a pair of Ed25519 credentials, with the collective responsibility of safeguarding the integrity of the constitution within the Cardano blockchain ecosystem.

## Guardians of Cardano's integrity

While the constitution cannot be directly enforced on-chain, the primary role of the constitutional committee is to assess the constitutionality of governance actions. By doing so, the committee plays a vital role in ensuring the blockchain's long-term sustainability. If the committee ever oversteps its designated boundary, it can be replaced through a 'no confidence' action.

In essence, the constitutional committee operates based on a social contract with the network's actors. The focus lies solely on voting in favor of actions that align with the constitution, thereby upholding the fundamental principles and values of the blockchain.

It's important to note that the constitutional committee does possess the authority to reject certain governance actions by voting 'no.' However, the committee members should exercise this power judiciously, solely when such actions are in clear conflict with the constitution.

In summary, the constitutional committee acts as the guardian of the blockchain's integrity, ensuring that the network operates in harmony with its established principles. Through responsible decision-making and adherence to the constitution, the committee contributes to the sustainable and prosperous future of the blockchain ecosystem.

## Becoming a constitutional committee member

Becoming a member of the constitutional committee involves off-chain procedures. The detailed process to join will be outlined in the upcoming weeks. Similar to how SPOs manage their cold/KES keys, committee members will utilize a cold/hot key setup. Therefore, it's crucial to acquaint yourself with generating and securely handling these keys if you aim to become a committee member.

In general, the constitutional committee member will need to:

1. Run a node
2. Request funds from the faucet
3. Generate cold/hot keys
4. Generate key hashes
5. Create a corresponding cold -> hot authorization certificate and submit it on-chain
6. Review active governance actions
7. Engage in discussions with other constitutional committee members to assess the constitutionality of governance actions
8. Cast votes
9. Include anchors (URL/hash) in their votes.

Moreover, the committee members might be required to perform specific tests, such as issuing a new hot key and authorizing it, resigning from committee members, or voting on new committee members.

Detailed tutorials will be provided as we approach the launch of associated features. These tutorials will offer step-by-step guidance to ensure a smooth and effortless walkthrough of the process.
