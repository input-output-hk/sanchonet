Welcome to SanchoNet - Your Gateway to Cardano's Governance Future!

We are thrilled to introduce you to SanchoNet, the testnet where we are set to roll out groundbreaking governance features for the Cardano blockchain, following the comprehensive CIP-1694 specifications. This is a pivotal milestone in the evolution of Cardano, and we couldn't be more excited to have you on board!

SanchoNet is not just another testnet; it is a vibrant and inclusive community-driven platform that offers the perfect opportunity for you to become intimately familiar with the implementation of the revolutionary governance system outlined in CIP-1694. Every member of the community is welcome to join SanchoNet and play an active role in shaping the future of Cardano's governance.

As we forge ahead on this journey of implementation and feature roll-out, we invite you to take on specific roles that will be instrumental in testing and refining the governance mechanisms:

1. Test-Ada Holders:
You, as a Test-Ada holder, have a crucial role to play. We encourage you to actively participate in creating and submitting governance actions. Your insights and feedback will be invaluable in ensuring that the governance system meets the highest standards of security and efficiency.

2. Stake Pool Operators:
Stake pool operators are the backbone of any blockchain network, and here at SanchoNet, it's no different. We call upon you to take charge and run the testnet network with diligence and integrity. Your ability to vote on relevant governance actions will significantly impact the direction of Cardano's governance evolution.

3. Delegate Representatives:
Delegate representatives are the voice of the broader community. As a representative, your role involves participating in voting on governance actions. We urge you to consider the collective interests of the Cardano community as you engage in these important decisions.

4. Constitutional Committee:
The Constitutional Committee holds the responsibility of ensuring that the governance process remains fair, transparent, and aligned with the best interests of the community and to the Cardano's Constitution. As a member of this committee, you will play a vital role in upholding the values that make Cardano a thriving ecosystem.

SanchoNet is not just a testnet; it is a playground of opportunities. It is a place where you can actively contribute to shaping the future of Cardano's governance and be part of a momentous shift in the blockchain landscape.

Together, we will create a governance system that is robust, decentralized, and truly community-driven. Your involvement, dedication, and passion will be the driving force behind the success of SanchoNet.

So, join us on this transformative journey! Let's embrace the challenges, learn together, and pave the way for a the Cardano governance system.
