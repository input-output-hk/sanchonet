title: 'Why SanchoNet?'

The selection of the name 'SanchoNet' draws inspiration from the intricate and multifaceted character of Sancho Panza, Don Quixote’s companion in Miguel de Cervantes’ literary classic. In the narrative, Sancho's transformation from a humble farmer to a wise governor and loyal friend mirrors virtues that align with the principles steering the evolution and governance of this network.

Sancho's growth throughout the novel represents a synthesis of realism and idealism. He starts with a practical, down-to-earth perspective but gradually appreciates and even embraces the nobility in Don Quixote's vision of chivalry. His transformation culminates in the episode of governing the fictional 'Island of Barataria,' where his innate wisdom and common sense guide him in delivering fair and wise judgments.

Sancho's capability to harmonize pragmatic realities with lofty ideals mirrors the essence of SanchoNet. Much like Sancho,  the mission of SanchoNet is to cultivate a system that remains grounded in reality while guided by visionary principles. The ultimate goal? To establish a platform where every voice holds significance, embracing inclusivity and pragmatic wisdom in governance.

The choice of 'SanchoNet' also mirrors the character's transformative journey, echoing the broader themes of growth, self-assurance, and integrity that resonate throughout 'Don Quixote.' The parallel between Sancho and the chivalric code, his self-discovery, and his courage to embrace the extraordinary within himself symbolize Cardano's aspiration to innovate, empower individuals, and attain greatness.

Moreover, the intimate relationship between Don Quixote and Sancho, characterized by friendship, mutual influence, and a complex balance between dreams and reality, parallels the collaborative spirit that SanchoNet aims to cultivate within the Cardano community. This partnership transcends mere transactional engagements and evolves into a collective journey toward a more equitable, visionary, and improved ecosystem.
