### Cardano SDK

[Cardano SDK](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-js-sdk) is a comprehensive suite of Typescript packages suitable for both Node.js and browser-based development,
used by [Lace](https://www.lace.io) at its core for everything relating to the Cardano blockchain.

The [core/Serialization](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-js-sdk/tree/master/packages/core/src/Serialization) package has support for serialization and deserialization,
developed from the ground up in Typescript.
* https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cardano-sdk/core
* [Usage examples](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-js-sdk/tree/master/packages/core/test/Serialization)

### Governance Metadata Standards

The Conway ledger era ushers in on-chain governance for Cardano via [CIP-1694 | A First Step Towards On-Chain Decentralized Governance](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-1694/README.md), with the addition of many new on-chain governance artifacts.
Some of these artifacts support the linking off-chain metadata, as a way to provide context.

There have been three governance metadata standards developed, so far, to define what the off-chain contextual data can look like.

* [CIP-100 | Governance Metadata](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0100) Base standard, providing a framework for future more specific standards.
* [CIP-108 | Governance Metadata - Governance actions](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0108) This proposal aims to provide a specification for off-chain metadata vocabulary that can be used to give context to governance actions.
* [CIP-119 | Governance Metadata - DReps](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0119) This proposal aims to provide a specification for off-chain metadata vocabulary that can be used to give context to CIP-100 for DRep registration and updates.

Two further standard is around the technical form of the constitution.

* [CIP-0120 | Constitution specification](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/796) This proposal aims to describe a standardized technical form for the Cardano constitution. Hoping to enhance the accessibility and safety of the document.
* [CIP-???? | Governance metadata - Constitutional Committee vote rationale](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/878) This proposal aims to provide a specification for off-chain metadata vocabulary that can be used to give context to constitutional committee votes.
