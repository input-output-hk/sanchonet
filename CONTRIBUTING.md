# Contributing to SanchoNet

Welcome to SanchoNet, where issues and pull requests are more than welcome!

For straightforward issues, such as typo corrections, we encourage you to make a pull request with the necessary fix, rather than opening an issue requesting someone else to address it.

Our intention is to make this website community-led, fun, and exciting. The more contributors we have, the better the experience will become.

Step onto the island of Barataria and join the adventure!
