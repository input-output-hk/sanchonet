Just as with stake delegation, the process of delegating votes to a SanchoNet DRep does not entail relinquishing control of your funds. Instead, the vote delegation certificate grants the selected DRep permission to vote on your behalf.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"tutorials/file-naming-convention":{"id":"tutorials/file-naming-convention","title":"File naming convention/schema","description":"To align the tutorials, examples, and also third-party tooling, you can find a suggested file naming convention/schema related to the Conway and Voltaire eras in this document.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"tutorials/keys-and-address":{"id":"tutorials/keys-and-address","title":"Generate keys and address","description":"First, generate a payment key pair and a stake key pair.
